# CMSC320 - Introduction to Data Science

Welcome to my repository for ```CMSC320 - Introduction to Data Science``` at the ```University of Maryland, College Park```. This repository includes a summary and the grade received for the homeworks and projects that I completed throughout this course. Due to university policies, the code for these projects is not publicly available. If you are an employer or have a legitimate request to view the code, please contact me directly.

## Assignments 

### Homework 1: **Pandas & SQL**
**Description:**  
This assignment focused on exploring and analyzing datasets using Pandas and SQL. Key topics covered include:
- Reading and manipulating datasets with **Pandas** (`read_csv`, filtering, grouping, replacing values).
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) with descriptive statistics and visualization (`hist`, `median`, `value_counts`).
- Writing **SQL queries** to extract insights from databases (`JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `AVG`).
- Cleaning and transforming data, including handling missing values and removing unwanted text.
- Running queries in **pandas with SQLite** to analyze real-world datasets.

**Grade:** 
- Pandas: 97/100
  - On Question 10, I inadvertently displayed both University of Maryland schools rather than only one.
- SQL: 100/100
